"use strict"; // Asking to treat our written code in JS as the newer version of JS

/*  

A while agp, JavaScript was not like the its is as of now. It was updated and classes etc were added into it.

So there was a lot of code written in the older version. The team behind JS did not want it to stop working so they made it workable aswell. This was a little background behind ' "use strict"; '
